Need the following bootloaders:
    dfu-programmer (http://dfu-programmer.github.io/)
    avrdude (http://nongnu.org/avrdude/)
    Teensy Loader (https://pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html)
    dfu-util (http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/)
    Massdrop Loader (https://github.com/massdrop/mdloader)
    bootloadHID (https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/bootloadhid.html)

ISP Flashers:
    USBTiny (AVR Pocket)
    AVRISP (Arduino ISP)
    USBasp (AVR ISP)

Concerns:
    Currently all flashers are included as binaries. I don't fully trust this as binaries between distros sometimes creates issues
